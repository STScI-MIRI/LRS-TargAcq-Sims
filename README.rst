LRS Target Acquisition Simulations
==================================

LRS target acquisition (TA) simulations were to determine the best method for
long target acquisitions. 

This code was also used to compute the TA exposures times needed based on
the desired centroiding accuracy and TA filter picked.  At the time, the TA
APT specifications were by flux of the TA target in the TA filter.
This approach is not how we are currently specifying TA in APT where the
ETC is used by the user to calculate the needed TA exposure time.
